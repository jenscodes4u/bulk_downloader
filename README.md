# bulk_downloader
Currently Scetching a prototype to bulk download html files given by a list

Its my fist github project and for my webscraping scripts a self adjusting bulk downloader would be a helpfull tool.

Its goal is to have a self throtteling and towards to stealth adjusting bulk downloader. whichs includes changing betweeen several browser diendities, changing ip adresses over VPN configuration and detect the best rate transfers per time and thinkable variables.
